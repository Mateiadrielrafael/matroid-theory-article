\section{Algebraic matroids}\label{sec:algebraic-matroids}

An interesting concept of independence arises in the study of field theory. We will present class of matroids derived from the concept of algebraic independence. For the rest of this section we will use the notation $\mathbb K / \mathbb F$ to refer to some field $\mathbb K$ and a subfield $\mathbb F$. See \hyperref[sec:appendix-fields]{the appendix} for an introduction to fields and subfields.

\begin{defn}
	A subset $S = \{ s_1 \ldots s _n \} \subseteq \mathbb K / \mathbb F$ is said to be algebraically independent (over $\mathbb F$) if there does not exist any
	nonzero multivariable polynomial in $n$ variables $f \in \mathbb{F}[X _1 \ldots X _n]$, with coefficients in $\mathbb{F} $, such that the evaluation homomorphism $\ev_{(s_1, s_2,\cdots,s_n)}(f) = 0$.
	%\begin{align*}
	%\text{for all } f \in \mathbb{F}[X _1 \ldots X _n], \left( f \neq  0 \land  f(s _1 \ldots s _n) = 0\right).
	%\end{align*}
\end{defn}
Intuitively, the definition say that no linear combination with coefficients in $\mathbb F$ of products of elements in $S$ is equal to $0$.

We know that an element $x\in \mathbb{R}$ is called transcendental with respect to $\mathbb{Q}$ if for nonzero polynomials with rational coefficients $\ev_{x}(p) \neq 0$. That means that any nontrivial polynomial evaluated at $x$ will never give 0.
Comparing with the definition of algebraically independent sets above, we see that a singleton ${x}$ is algebraically independent by our defintion, if for any nonzero  single variable ($n = 1$) polynomial $p$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$ we will have that $\ev_{x}(p) \neq 0$. This is precisely the definition of transcendental numbers.

Although it is well known in the mathematical community that the complex numbers $e$ and $\pi$ are transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$, it hasn't yet been proven that $\{e, \pi \}$ is algebraically independent.

We will now discuss the notion of algebraic dependence.

\begin{defn}
	Let $a \in \mathbb K / \mathbb F$ and $B = \{b _1, \ldots, b _n \} \subseteq  \mathbb K / \mathbb F$. We say that $a$ is algebraically dependent on $B$ (over $ \mathbb{F} $) if $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb F(b _1, \ldots, b _n )$. Given some $A \subseteq  \mathbb K / \mathbb{F} $, we say that $A$ is algebraically dependent on $B$ (over $\mathbb{F} $) if every element of $A$ if algebraic on $B$ (over $\mathbb{F} $).
\end{defn}

Before continuing onto the next lemma, we remind the reader that a field $\mathbb{K}$ has a natural $\mathbb{K}$-vector space structure, thus scalars are elements of $\mathbb{F} $ and vectors being elements of $\mathbb K$. Moreover, the vector space induced by $\mathbb{F} (a)$ over $\mathbb{F} $ when $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F} $ is finite dimensional. For more details see lemmas (\ref{lem:field-extension-vector-space}) and (\ref{lem:algebraic-field-finite-vector-space}).

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:algebraic-transitivity}
	Consider $a, b \in \mathbb K / \mathbb{F} $ such that $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F}(b) $ and $b$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F}$. It then follows that $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The vector spaces induced by $\mathbb{F} (b)$ and $\mathbb{F} (b)(a)$ must both be finite dimenssional over $\mathbb{F} $ and $\mathbb{F} (b)$ respectively (because $b$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F} $ and $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F} (b)$). It follows that $\mathbb{F} (b)(a)$ is finitely dimenssional over $\mathbb{F}$ (this can be seen by noticing that given a basis $\{a _i \}$ for $\mathbb{F} (b)(a)$ over $\mathbb{F} (b)$ and a basis $\{b _i\}$ for $\mathbb{F} (b)$ over $\mathbb{F} $, we can form a basis $\{a _i b _j\}$ for $\mathbb{F} (b)(a)$ over $\mathbb{F} $).

	Let $n$ be the dimenssion of $\mathbb{F} (b)(a)$ over $\mathbb{F} $. Let $S = \{a ^0 \ldots a ^n \}$. Because $|S| = n + 1$, $S$ cannot be linearly independent (in the vector space induced by $\mathbb{F} (b)(a)$ over $\mathbb{F} $), which means a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F} [x]$ exists such that $ev_a(f) = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:algebraic-dependence-transitivity}
	Consider $A, B, C \subseteq \mathbb K / \mathbb{F} $ such that $A$ is algebraically dependent on $B$ and $B$ is algebraically dependent on $C$. It then follows that $A$ is algebraically dependent on $C$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We will proceed by induction on the size of $B$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $|B| = 1$ then the result trivially follows from lemma (\ref{lem:algebraic-transitivity}).
		\item Assume the result is true for $|B| = n$. We will attempt to prove it for $|B| = n + 1$. Let $a \in A$. We have to show that $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F}(c _1 \ldots c _k )$. Given $1 \leq i \leq n$, each $b _i$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F}(c _1 \ldots c _k )$ (because $B$ is algebraically dependent on $C$ (over $\mathbb{F}$)). It then follows that each such $b _i $ is also algebraic over $\mathbb{F}(c _1 \ldots c _k, b _{n + 1}) = \mathbb{F} (b _{n + 1} )(c _1 \ldots c _k )$. Moreover, we know that $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F} (b _1 \ldots b _{n + 1})$, which means it is also algebraic over $\mathbb{F} (b _{n + 1})(b _1 \ldots b _n )$. It then follows from the induction hypothesis (applied with $\mathbb{F} (b _{n + 1})$ as the base field, $A = \{a\}$, $B = \{b _1 \ldots b _n \}$ and the same $C$) that $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F} (b _{n + 1})(c _1 \ldots c _k ) = \mathbb{F} (c _1 \ldots c _k )(b _{n + 1})$.

		      We recall that $b _{n + 1}$ is algebraic on $\mathbb{F} (c _1 \ldots c _k )$ (because $B$ is algebraically dependent on $C$ (over $\mathbb{F} $)). We can now apply lemma (\ref{lem:algebraic-transitivity}) to prove that $a$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F} (c _1 \ldots c _n)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:algebraic-matroids-are-matroids}
	Given a finite subset $E \subseteq \mathbb K / \mathbb F$, the pair $(E, \mathcal I)$  where $\mathcal I$ is the set of algebraically independent subsets of $E$ forms a matroid.
\end{theorem}

Although~\cite{oxley1} offers a proof based on independent sets and the concept of algebraic dependence, we will instead present a proof based on the bases of our supposed matroid. The part focused on proving lemma (\ref{lem:algebraic-indep-smaller-than-dep}) is inspired by~\cite{milne2022}, although the rest will be a lot simpler (no need to involve Zorn's lemma) because we are working in a finite subset.


We start by introducing some useful lemmas:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:algebraic-indep-smaller-than-dep}
	Consider finite $A, B \subseteq \mathbb K / \mathbb F$, such that $A$ is independent over $\mathbb F$ and dependent on $B$ (over $\mathbb F$). Then $|B| \geq |A|$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We will prove the statement by induction on the number of elements in $A \setminus B$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $A \setminus B = \emptyset $ then $A \subseteq B$ and $|A| \leq |B|$ follows trivially.
		\item Assume the statemenet is true for some $|A \setminus B| = p$. We will attempt to prove it for $|A \setminus B| = p + 1$. Let $k = |A \cap B| = |A| - p$. Let $a _1 \ldots a _n$ be the elements of $A$ such that $a _1 \ldots a_k$ are all the members of $A \cap B$ for some $k$. Let $ a _1 \ldots a_k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _m$ be the elements of $B$. It remains to prove that $m \geq n$.

		      As $a _{k + 1}$ is not dependent on $\{a _1 \ldots a_k\}$ but is dependent on $B = \{a _1 \ldots a _k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b_m\}$, there must exist some $k + 1 \leq j \leq m$ such that $a _{k + 1}$ is dependent on $\{a _1 \ldots a _k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b_j\}$ but  not on $\{a _1 \ldots a _k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j - 1}\}$. Because $a _{k + 1}$ is dependent on $\{a _1 \ldots a _k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b_j\}$, we know there exists some polynomial $f \in \mathbb F[x _1 \ldots x _{j + 1}]$ such that
		      \begin{align*}
			      f(a _1 \ldots a _{k}, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j}, X) \neq  0 \land
			      f(a _1 \ldots a _{k}, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j}, a _{k + 1})  = 0.
		      \end{align*}

		      We can write $f$ as
		      \begin{align*}
			      f(x _1 \ldots x _{j + 1})
			      = \sum_i f _i(x _1 \ldots x _{j - 1}, x _{j + 1}) x _j ^i.
		      \end{align*}

		      We know that $f(a _1 \ldots a _{k}, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j}, X) \neq  0$, therefore at least one of $f _i \neq 0$. Let $g = f _i $ such that $f _i \neq 0$. Because $a _{j + 1}$ is not algebraic over $\{a _1 \ldots a _k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j - 1}\}$, we know that
		      \begin{align*}
			      g(a _1 \ldots a _k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j - 1}, a _{k + 1}) \neq 0.
		      \end{align*}

		      This implies that $f(a _1 \ldots a _k, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j - 1}, X, a _{k + 1}) \neq 0$. Since $ f(a _1 \ldots a _{k}, b _{k + 1} \ldots b _{j}, a _{k + 1})  = 0$, we can conclude that $b_j$ is algebraic over $\{a _1 \ldots a _{k + 1}, b _{k + 2} \ldots b _j\}$.

		      Construct $B' = B + a _{k + 1} - b_j$. Having proven that $b_j$ is dependent on a subset of $B'$, it is also dependent on $B'$. All other elements of $B$ are also dependent on $B'$ (because any variable is algebraic over a field extension it generates, i.e. $t$ is algebraic over $\mathbb F(t)$). We recall that $A$ is dependent on $B$, so by the transitivity of algebraic dependence (lemma (\ref{lem:algebraic-dependence-transitivity})), we know that $A$ is algebraically dependent on $B'$. We also notice that $A$ and $B'$ have $k + 1$ elements in common, therefore the statement is proven by the induction hypothesis.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

We will now show that all bases in our supposed matroid have equal cardinality.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:algebraic-matroid-equal-size-bases}
	Given some finite subset $E \subseteq \mathbb K / \mathbb F$, maximally independent subsets (bases) of $E$ have equal cardinality.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be maximal independent subsets of $E$. If both sets are $\emptyset$, then our proof is done. If one set is $\emptyset$ and one isn't, we clearly have a contradiction, as $\emptyset$ is a strict subset of the other set, hence not maximal. We therefore assume the existence of some $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

	We know that $A$ is maximal, therefore any $b \in B$ is algebraically dependent on $A$. We can therefore conclude that $B$ is algebraically dependent on $B$. We recall that $B$ is also independent, which means we can use lemma (\ref{lem:algebraic-indep-smaller-than-dep}) to prove that $|A| \geq |B|$. We can apply a similar argument to show that $|B| \geq |A|$, which together with our previous statement shows that $|A| = |B|$, proving the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of theorem (\ref{thm:algebraic-matroids-are-matroids})]
	We will construct the matroid using the basis definition (theorem (\ref{thm:basis-axioms-form-matroid})). We need to first show that at least one exists, and then show that the exchange property holds.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(B1)] We consider the partially ordered set of independent subsets of $E$ ordered by inclusion. We notice that $ \emptyset $ is independent (as the only polynomial of $0$ variables which can be satisfied by $\emptyset $ is the trivial polynomial). Any finite nonempty partially ordered set has at least one maximal element, so a basis exists.
		\item[(B2)] It now remains to prove the exchange property. That is, given two bases $A, B \subseteq \mathcal B$ and some $a \in A \setminus B$, we can find some $b \in B \setminus A$ such that $B - b + a \in \mathcal B$. Let $n = |A| = |B|$ (we know the two bases have equal cardinality from lemma (\ref{lem:algebraic-matroid-equal-size-bases})). Assume the statement is not true. That is, all $b _i \in B$ are dependent on $A - a$, which means $B$ is dependent on $A - a$. It follows from lemma (\ref{lem:algebraic-indep-smaller-than-dep}) that $|B| \leq |A - a|$, which is equivalent to $n \leq n - 1$, hence a contradiction.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
