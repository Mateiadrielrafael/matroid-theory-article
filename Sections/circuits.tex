\subsection{Circuits}\label{sec:circuits}
As mentioned above, we can define matroids in many different ways. One such way is defining matroids in terms of minimally dependent sets --- which we refer to as circuits.

\begin{defn}
Let $M = (E, \mathcal{I})$ be a matroid. Any subset $D \in \mathcal{I}$ which is not independent is called dependent. Circuits are minimal dependent sets of $M$. We will denote the collection by $\mathcal{C}(M)$. Additionally, we will refer to circuits of $M$ that have $n$ elements as $n$-circuits.
\end{defn}

The name is a reference to matroid circuits corresponding to circuits of the underlying graph when talking about graphic matroids (which we will discuss in section (\ref{sec:graphic-matroids})).

Similarly, as with the independent set definition, we can use circuits to formulate an axiomatic definition of matroids. Moreover, in the same way we can use the independent sets of a matroid to determine its circuits, we can use the circuits of a matroid to determine its independent sets.

\begin{defn}
    Let $E$ be a non-empty finite set, and $\mathcal{C}$ a collection of subsets of $E$, called circuits, such that:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[C1)] $\emptyset \notin \mathcal{C}$

        \item[(C2)] If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are members of $\mathcal{C}$ and $C_1 \subseteq C_2$, then $C_1 = C_2$.

        \item[(C3)] If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are distinct members of $\mathcal{C}$ and there exist an $e \in C_1 \cap C_2$, then there is a member $C_3$ of $\mathcal{C}$, such that $C_3 \subseteq (C_1  \cup C_2) - e$
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp}
  Consider figure (\ref{fig:1234-matroid-circuits}). This is the same matroid example as in figure (\ref{fig:1234-matroid-bases}). We've also highlighted circuits (in blue). The circuits are minimal dependent sets, where sets above are dependent. Also note how all independent sets contain no circuits.

\begin{exmp}
To get an intuition behind (C3), let us consider the matroid induced by the graph in figure (\ref{fig:amogus}). We will discuss graphic matroids later, but for now consider cycles of the graph as circuits. The diagram highlights two circuits --- $C_1$ and $C_2$ --- that share an edge ($e$). Taking the union of both circuits and removing $e$ yields a subgraph contains another cycle --- circuit $C_3$.

% We can say that a set $X \subseteq E$ is independent if and only if, it does not contain any circuit.
% The concept of circuits points towards something similar to a complement of the independent sets, but not completely. It is only the minimal dependent, and not all dependet subsets. We now have the following theorem.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:circuits-have-properties}
  All circuits in a matroid satisfy (C1), (C2) and (C3).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} We will prove each property individually:
  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(C1)] $\emptyset \in \mathcal I$, therefore $\emptyset$ is not dependent (which means it cannot be a circuit)
    \item[(C2)] A counterexample to this clause would violate $C _2$ being minimal.
    \item[(C3)] Assume a counterexample exists. Because $C _1 \cup C _2 - e$ does not contain a circuit, it must be an element of $\mathcal I$. 

        We claim that $C _2 \setminus C _1$ is nonempty. Assume this is not the case. That would imply $C _2 \subseteq C _1$, but $C _1 \neq C _2 $ by (C3), which means that $C _1 $ is a proper subset of $C _2$. As both $C _1 $ and $C _2 $ are members of $\mathcal C$, this violates (C2), and is a contradiction. We can then assume some $f \in C _2 \setminus C _1 $ exists.

        As $C _2$ is minimally dependent, we know that $C _2 - f$ is independent. Let $I$ be a maximal independent subset of $C _2 \cup C _1$ which is a superset of $C _2 - f$. Clearly, $f \not\in I$ (otherwise $C _2 \subseteq I \in \mathcal I$). Furthermore, as $C _1 $ is a circuit, we know that $C _1 \not \subseteq I \in \mathcal I$ (otherwise $C _1$ would be independent). This means some $g \in C _1$ exists such that $g \not\in I$. As $f \in C _2  \setminus  C _2$, we know that $f \neq g$.

        As $I \subseteq C _1 \cup C _2$ and $f, g \in C _1 \cup C _2$ but $f, g \not\in I$, we can infer that 
        \begin{align*}
        |I| \leq |C _1 \cup C _2 - f - g| = |C _1 \cup C _2| - 2.
        \end{align*}

        We also notice that $|C _1 \cup C _2 - e| = |C _1 \cup C _2 | - 1$. We can now conclude by transitivity with $|C _1 \cup C _2 | - 2 < |C _1 \cup C _2 | - 1$ that $|I| < |C _1 \cup C _2 - e|$. We recall that both $I$ and $C _1 \cup C _2 - e$ are members of $\mathcal I$. We can apply (I3) to generate a superset of $I$ which contradicts it's maximality.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:matroid-circuit-definition}
Let $E$ be a set and $\mathcal C$ be a collection of subsets of $E$ which satisfies the conditions outlined above. Let  $\mathcal I$  be the collection of subsets of $E$ that contain no member of $\mathcal C$, that is 

\begin{align}
   % \forall X \in \mathcal{I}, \forall C \in \mathcal C,  C \not \subseteq X. 
   \mathcal{I} = \{I \in 2^E |\; \text{for all } \; C \in \mathcal{C}\; \text{we have} \; C \not\subseteq I\}
    \label{independent-sets-from-circuits}
\end{align}

    The pair $(E,\mathcal I)$ is a matroid having $\mathcal C$ as its collection of circuits.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} We start by showing that $\mathcal I $ satisfies the necessary conditions for $(E, \mathcal I )$ to be a matroid:
    \begin{enumerate} 
        \item[(I1)] The only subset of $\emptyset $ is $ \emptyset $, but $ \emptyset \not\in \mathcal C $, so $ \emptyset $ satisfies (\ref{independent-sets-from-circuits}), hence $\emptyset \in \mathcal I$.
        \item[(I2)] Assume we have $X \subseteq Y \in \mathcal I$. Assume that $X \not\in I$, i.e.\ there exists some $C \in \mathcal C $ such that $C \subseteq X$. We recall that $\subseteq $ is transitive, thus $C \subseteq Y$ and $Y \not\in I$, hence a contradiction.
        \item[(I3)] Given $X, Y \in \mathcal I $ with $|X| < |Y|$ we must show there exists some $e \in Y \setminus X$ such that $X \cup \{e\} \in \mathcal I$. Assume that such an $e$ does not exist, i.e.\ for all $e \in Y \setminus X$ we have some circuit $C _e \in \mathcal C $ such that $C _e \subseteq X \cup \{e\}$. We obviously have $e \in C_e$, because otherwise $C_e \subseteq X$ and $X \not\in \mathcal I$.


     Let $X' = X \setminus Y$ and $Y' = Y \setminus X$. We will prove the statement by induction: given some set $S \subseteq X'$, a set of circuits $D \subseteq \mathcal C$ with $\forall C \in D, C \subseteq  S \cup Y$ and a surjective but not injective function $f : D \to S$ such that $f(D)$ is maximal in size and $\forall C \in D, f(C) \in C$, our statement is proven. We will use induction on the size of $S$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If $S = \{e\}$ only has one element, we know that $f$ is not injective, so we must have distinct $C _1, C _2 \in D$ such that $e = f(C _1 ) = f(C _2)$. We can use the $3$-rd circuit axiom to generate some circuit $C _3 \subseteq C _1 \cup C _2 - e$. We recall that $C _1 , C _2 \subseteq S \cup Y $, so $C _3 \subseteq S \cup Y - e$ which implies $C _3 \subseteq Y$, which is a contradiction.
        \item Inductive step. Assuming the statement is true for all choices of $S$ with $k$ elements, we will attempt to prove it is also true when $S$ has $k + 1$ elements. Recalling that $f$ is not injective, we must have distinct $C _1, C _2 \in D$ such that $f(C _1 ) = f(C _2)$. Let $g = f(C _1)$. We have $g \in C _1, C _2$, so by the $3$-rd circuit axiom we must have some circuit $C  _3 \subseteq C _1 \cup C _2 - g$. Let $S' = C _3 \cap X'$. 

            For all $e \in S'$, we claim there must exist some $C_e \in D$ such that $e = f(C_e)$. Assume this is not the case, i.e.\ there is some $e \in S'$ such that no valid choice of $C_e$ exists. Given that $e \in S'$, we know that either $e \in C_1$ or $e \in C_2$. After a potential swap, we assume that $e \in C_1$. We can now define $f'(C) = e$ when $C = C_1$ and $f'(C) = f(C)$. Because no choice of $C_e$ exists, we know that $e \not\in f(D)$. Because $f(C _1 ) = f(C _2 )$ we have $f(D) = f(D - C _1 )$ which lets us compute $f'(D) = f(D) \cup \{e\}$, which means $f(D)$ was not maximal, hence a contradiction. Our claim is then true.

            Define $D' = \{C_e | e \in S'\} \cup \{C _3 \}$. We've essentially proven in the last paragraph that $f : \{C_e | e \in S'\} \to S'$ is still a  surjective function. It then follows that $h = f : D' \to S'$ is surjective as well. By the Pigeonhole principle, we know $h$ cannot be injective, because $|D'| = |S'| + 1$. We are now almost ready to apply the induction hypothesis to $(S', D', h)$. We've shown a choice for $h$ exist. If this choice is not maximal, swap it with a maximal choice (we had to show that at least one choice exists for a maximal choice to exist). We can now apply the induction hypothesis, proving the statement.
    \end{enumerate}

    We notice that $X$ can be partitioned into $X'$ and $X \cap Y$, hence $|X| = |X'| + |X \cap Y|$. We can follow a similar process for $Y$. Combining the two together with the fact that $|X| < |Y|$ yields that $|X'| < |Y'|$. We know that $Y \in \mathcal I$ so $\forall e \in Y', C_e \not \subseteq  Y$, but $C_e \subseteq  X \cup \{e\}$ therefore there must exist some $c_e \in C_e \cap X'$. 

    We define $D = \{C_e, e \in Y'\}$, $f(C_e) = c_e$ and $S = f(D)$. Furthermore, we know that $f$ is not injective by the Pigeonhole principle (we have $|D| = |Y'| > |X'| \geq |S|$). We also know, by the definition of $S$, that $f$ is surjective. We've shown a choice of $f$ exists. If it is not maximal, swap it with a maximal choice. We can now apply the statement proven by induction to finish the proof.
\end{enumerate}


We now show that $C$ is a circuit for the newly defined matroid if and only if it is a member of $\mathcal C$. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[$\implies$]
  If $C$ is a circuit, then $C \not\in \mathcal I$, which means that $C$ contains some $D \in \mathcal C$. As $C$ is minimally dependent, all its proper subsets are independent, but members of $\mathcal C$ cannot be independent (as seen in the definition of $\mathcal I$), which implies that $C = D$, hence $C \in \mathcal C$.
  \item[$\impliedby$]
  Let $C \in \mathcal C$. Assume $C$ is not a circuit. Clearly, $C \not\in \mathcal I$ is implied by the definition of $\mathcal I$ seen above. This implies that $C$ is dependent but not a circuit, which means $C$ is not miminal. 

  A proper subset $D  \subseteqneq C$ must then exist such that $D$ is a circuit. We've already shown in the $\implies$ direction how this implies $D \in \mathcal C$. We have now constructed a contradiction to (C2), hence our assumption that such a circuit exists is false.

\end{enumerate}



  We can now conclude that $(E, \mathcal I)$ is indeed a matroid with $\mathcal C$ as it's set of circuits.
\end{proof}
